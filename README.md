Today is Monday, July 17th.  Oh my, what a day...this if the very first day of code school and I am working hard to keep my 
head above water.  I do not have a clue about what I am doing and I am waiting for the day that I can laugh about this.  
I have ABSOLUTELY NO CODING BACKGROUND! & it is showing...they say this is normal...we'll see.
